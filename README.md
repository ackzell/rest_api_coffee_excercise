rest_api_coffee_excercise
=========================

Exercise to build a restful api using mongoose and coffeescript.

Will be based on [this](http://zaiste.net/2012/11/restful_api_with_express_mongoose_on_coffeescript/) post by [ZAISTE](http://zaiste.net/about/)

And also on [this entry] (http://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript/build-a-restful-api-using-node-and-express-4) on Scotch.io

Aim is to include the coffeescript language in the process of learning how to develop the API.
